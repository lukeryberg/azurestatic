            <h2>About Luke Tech</h2>
            <p> Hello there,</p> <br>
            <p>I'm an IT guy Specializing in Azure data systems, I started this little LLC to help small businesses go from paper and pen, or Excel and Yahoo, to modernizing into a fully-fledged, automated, simplified, scalable, unified cloud-based organization that is secure and in your control.</p> <br>
            <p>I am not an iPhone app idea guy, nor am I a website developer (as if this site didn't give that away), but I am a business-minded IT systems and operations guy. If you need an app or a website, I got a guy for that.</p> <br>
            <p>Regardless of what your company does, whether it's making ice cream or curing cancer, you probably have big, old, weird, disconnected pieces of tech that frustrate you and hold you back from growing. I can design and implement new systems to make your operations smoother.</p><br>
            <p>I also am available for personal IT issues like recovering your locked iPhone and transferring your data from your old iMac to your MacBook.</p><br>
